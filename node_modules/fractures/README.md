## Baseline atomic CSS toolkit.

Fractures helps you bootstrap design-systems and prototypes by providing a set of non-blocking, atomic, utility classes.

Read the [docs](https://fractures.space/docs) for examples, or find out [more](https://fractures.space/about).

### Goals

- You can design with &mdash; not around it. Leaves UI untouched.
- Atomic, non blocking.

- Fast in every way.
- Framework agnostic.
